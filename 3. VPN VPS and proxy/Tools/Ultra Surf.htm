<h1 align=center style='text-align:center'>UltraSurf User¡¯s Guide</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>UltraSurf is a flagship anti-censorship product by
UltraReach&nbsp;Internet Corp. It protects users¡¯ internet privacy, enables
users inside countries with heavy Internet censorship to visit any public web
sites in the world safely and freely.</p>

<h3><i><span style='font-size:16.0pt'>I. Installation and Usage</span></i></h3>

<h3><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>1. Download and Installation</span></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>UltraSurf is green software, no installation is needed. You
can start the program simply by double-clicking the executable file.&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Users may save it in a flash drive or save it in an email
box. You may use it on any computer, without leaving any trace on that
computer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The photo icon of UltraSurf is a sailing boat navigating
around the globe. We may change the file name of the .exe file. Users may also
change the file name for their own safety and convenience.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>2. Start UltraSurf</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>After you double click the executable file, UltraSurf will
open the Interface window. The interface will have the function keys and the
operation status</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If UltraSurf prompts a window for proxy setup, please refer
to step 8 for proxy configuration. If UltraSurf does not open the home page,
please refer to step 7 on advanced settings.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>3. Server Connection and Operation Status Display</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>UltraSurf Interface displays the status of server connection
and operation. At start, UltraSurf automatically searches and chooses the
highest speed server available. The check box and the green light indicate
which server is currently in use. You may select different server by checking
another check box if current one is not working properly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Connection speed is an indicator of the performance of the
server: 100% is the highest speed and is equivalent to direct connection.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>4. How to Use UltraSurf Program</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A user is able to browse any website from the IE for the
homepage or open a new window of IE to browse. For example, if the user wants
to browse the Secret China news web site, simply enter the URL <a
href="http://www.secretchina.com/">http://www.secretchina.com</a> directly in
the small URL window of the IE, UltraSurf will bring up the web site
immediately.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Note: You may minimize the interface window when using
UltraSurf. You may not close the window, or you exit the UltraSurf.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>5. Exit UltraSurf Program</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You can click ¡°Exit¡± key on the UltraSurf interface or close
the interface window to exit the Ultra. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Once you exit UltraSurf, your IE browser is no longer under
protection of UltraSurf. For your safety, during the 20 seconds count-down
before the exit, an ¡°Exit Warning¡± will be prompted with the following options:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:72.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>¡¤<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Close IE and exit.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:54.0pt'>This option allows you close all
current browser windows when you exit UltraSurf. It¡¯s recommended that you
choose this option, because it¡¯s very likely that the browser windows have URLs
of some censored websites you browsed using UltraSurf. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:72.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>¡¤<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Keep IE and exit.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:54.0pt'>If you have a special need to
keep current IE browser windows open, and you are aware of the safety issues,
you can select this option, which make UltraSurf not close any browser windows
current open during the exiting process.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:54.0pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>6. Function Keys on UltraSurf Interface</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The UltraSurf Interface is shown on the desktop during the
whole process when UltraSurf&nbsp; is running. A user may minimize the
interface. The following is the instruction for all function keys:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:90.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>¡¤<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

</span></span>¡°Option¡±: It provides advanced settings. Please refer to Step 7
for details.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:90.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>¡¤<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>¡°Help¡±: It will prompt this user guide on the IE browser.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:90.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>¡¤<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>¡°Exit¡±:&nbsp; Click this key to stop Ultrasurf. By default, UltraSurf
will clear the browsing history, restore default setting and perform a series
of other tasks before quitting the program. Please refer to Step 5 ¡°Exit
UltraSurf Program¡±. A user may also click the ¡°X¡± key on the upper right corner
of the UltraSurf interface to stop the program.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:72.0pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>7. Advance Setting</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The default setting of UltraSurf is intended to protect the
users¡¯ safety. Users with special needs may alter these settings to specify
whether they want to clear the browsing history, to delete Cookie and to use
proxy. The following are detailed instructions for the options in ¡°advanced
setting¡±.</p>

<ul type=disc>
 <ul type=circle>
  <ul type=square>
   <li class=MsoNormal>¡°Do not use IE¡±: if you do not want to use IE with
       UltraSurf, you may select this option. When selected, UltraSurf will not
       manage or change any IE settings and other IE related options will be
       inactive.</li>
   <li class=MsoNormal>¡°Delete Cookie¡± Button: click here to delete all the
       Cookies immediately.</li>
   <li class=MsoNormal>¡°Delete History¡± Button: click here to delete all
       browsing history immediately</li>
   <li class=MsoNormal>¡°Start IE automatically¡±: If this option is checked,
       UltraSurf will automatically open an IE browser on start; if this option
       is unchecked, UltraSurf will not open IE browser or any other website
       when it is started.</li>
   <li class=MsoNormal>¡°Delete cookie automatically on exit¡±: UltraSurf will
       automatically delete Cookie when exit. This is the default setting. The
       user may decide not to delete Cookie and uncheck this option.</li>
   <li class=MsoNormal>¡°Delete history automatically on exit¡±: UltraSurf will
       automatically delete the browse history on exit if this option is
       checked. </li>
   <li class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;¡°Close IE immediately on exit¡±: When this option
       is checked, UltraSurf software will close all IE browsers and all
       websites when it exits. If this option is unchecked, the user may choose
       to retain or close IE windows. Please refer to Step 5 (Exit UltraSurf
       Program) for details.</li>
   <li class=MsoNormal>¡°Do not close IE on exit¡±: When this option is checked,
       UltarSurf will not close IE windows, nor will it show the ¡°Exit Warning¡±
       window on exit.</li>
   <li class=MsoNormal>¡°Hide Golden Lock (take effect on next start)¡±: By
       default a Golden Lock on lower right corner of the window indicates you
       are under UltraSurf¡¯s protection. You may hide the Golden Lock by
       checking this option which will take effect next time you start
       UltraSurf. </li>
   <li class=MsoNormal>¡°Proxy setting¡± button: click it to enter the proxy
       setting window. Please refer to ¡°Manual Proxy Setting¡± below.</li>
  </ul>
 </ul>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>&nbsp;8. Manual Proxy Setting</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Normally users do not need to enter proxy setting
themselves. By default UltraSurf will choose the proxy setting based on your IE
proxy setting. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In certain cases users may need to use proxy to access
internet. This option allows users to manually set proxy for UltraSurf.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The following is the instruction for proxy setting:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<ul type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal>¡°Auto-Detect Proxy¡±: When checked, UltraSurf will
     automatically detect the proxy setting of IE browser. </li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>¡°Manual Proxy Setting¡±: When checked, you can enter your
     own proxy setting.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>¡°Directly use UltraSurf¡±: When checked, user will use the
     100% transparent and highly encrypted UltraSurf directly, without the
     involvement of other proxy servers. If the user has entered a proxy server
     on IE, that proxy server will not be used; it will resume to be the proxy
     server for your IE after you quit UltraSurf program.</li>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=Heading3Char><span style='font-size:13.5pt'><br>
</span></span><a name="safety_3rdparty">1. Is it safe to use UltraSurf to visit
any websites? Can third party software monitor what websites are being opened?</a><br>
A: UltraReach uses advanced technology for encryption. All the contents are
encrypted. No third party can detect what websites you are visiting. Privacy is
our first priority. <br>
<br>
<a name="safety_ip">2. If I use UltraSurf to post on forums or visit web sites,
does the forum or web site know my real IP?</a><br>
A: No. UltraSurf uses advance proxy technology. It will hide your real IP from
all websites. <br>
<br>
<a name="safety_history">3. After using UltraSurf, are there any web history
records on my computer?</a><br>
A: No. After you quit the program, UltraSurf will clean all web history. <br>
<br>
<a name="safety_virus">4. Is UltraSurf a Trojan or virus?</a><br>
A: Neither. UltraSurf provides users with state-of-the-art internet technology
to break through firewall safely. It is a popular anti-censorship software, not
a Trojan or virus. Some anti-virus software companies classify UltraSurf as a
Trojan software simply because UltraSurf is able to break through firewalls. It
is a mistake and a wrong classification. We are in the process of resolving
this issue with these anti-virus companies through technique channels and legal
channels. It is our mission to protect users' privacy when browsing the
internet. Please rest assured that UltraSurf will not touch any of the
documents on your PC. <br>

Start/Shutdown/Configuration ---------</span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><br>
<a name="conf_noconnect">5. What should I do if UltraSurf cannot connect to
internet?</a><br>
A: Please follow the steps below:<br>
1) Check if you can connect to internet directly.<br>
2) If your internet is OK, please shutdown your firewall, anti-virus Software.
Restart the UltraSurf.<br>
3) If you still cannot connect to internet, it is probably because our servers
are too busy. Please try it again later. If you have this problem very often,
please send us your detailed platform and network environment information.<br>
<br>
<a name="conf_noserver">6. Why is UltraSurf sometimes unable find servers?</a><br>
A: If it is temporarily network issue, you can try it later. If you see
UltraSurf user interface displays &quot;network connection failure, check your
network and proxy setting&quot;, please check network connection setting or
proxy setting, and firewall setting. If you still cannot connect to our sites,
please send us your detailed platform and network environment information. <br>
<br>
<a name="conf_noie">7. After starting UltraSurf, IE browser cannot
automatically start.</a><br>
A: You can open IE browser manually. You probably have disabled the 'auto start
IE' option. You can enable it by clicking Advance Setting on UltraSurf

<br>
<a name="conf_slow">8. What can I do if the speed is slower than normal?</a><br>

<p class=MsoNormal>Founded by a group of successful entrepreneurs, renowned
scientists and engineers in Silicon Valley who dedicated to providing
technologies and service for people to exchange information on Internet freely
and safely, UltraReach is the first company with a mission that offers Internet
technology and service immune to the national Internet censorship in China. <br>
<br>
Internet anti-censorship technology was thought of as &quot;mission
impossible&quot; two years ago. We started thorough R&amp;D on other existing
technologies as well as from end users' perspective. While other existing
technologies were developed for user's privacy and anonymity on Internet, we
solved the connection and reconnection problem, which is the key issue for user
to access web site without being blocked. Built on solid theoretical analysis
and professional quality, UltraReach has successfully invented the technology
platform called the GIFT system, which offers guaranteed connection and
reconnection service to users inside these censor countries and capability of
serving very large number of users with affordable resource. More than one year
live service performance has proved that the GIFT technology has successfully
broken through the so-called &quot;Great Firewall&quot; which is built with
state-of-art firewall equipments and softwares with virtually unlimited
resource from government. <br>
<br>
Powered by GIFT technology, UltraReach.Net portal is the first home page for
users to visit when they are connected to our service. Through the web portal
users inside the censored zones can surf any public web sites in the free
world. It naturally becomes a precious window for users inside China to look out for world news and other web contents that are blocked. The
UltraReach.Net attracts thousands of users in China with daily news stories,
featured articles and links from world media, governmental and non-governmental
organizations, different groups and individual sites. <br>
<br>
The outstanding performance of our service has made UltraReach Internet well
known among the users who seek the Internet freedom in the censored country,
and at the meantime attracted heavy attacks from Chinese Internet police. The
GIFT system has survived various assaults including DNS hijacking, IP blocking,
DOS attacking etc. We've taken the threats from the censor as opportunities to
continuously improve the performance and reliability of our technology. In
fact, the GIFT system has been mature enough for reliable service and it
depends on the financial resource to expand its user base. <br>
<br>
The next-level solution from UltraReach Internet as well as the real time
performance has proved that our system and service is by far superior to other
existing technologies. The main differentiators consist of anti-blocking power,
connection and re-connection capability and the ability to serve and maintain a
very large number of users from inside China. As the clear leader among the
Internet anti-jamming technology and service providers, we are currently the
only one that can offer reliable service to deliver web contents to the massive
number of users in China. </p>
